# OrgAlkCalc

This is a package which you can use to compute organic alkalinity from titrations.

## Usage
This toolbox contains two basic classes which may be used to perform organic 
alkalinity calculations: `OrgAlkTitration` and `OrgAlkTitrationBatch`.
- `OrgAlkTitrationBatch` is intended as a 'batch mode', which will allow the user
to perform calculations with no additional input.
- `OrgAlkTitration` is more granular, allowing the user to specify in detail how
they wish the calculation to be performed.
